#Genetics Game#


Introduction:

This game will help students learn the difference between dominant and recessive alleles and how different combinations are expressed in the phenotype.


Home Page:

User chooses from "Determining Phenotypes", and "Predicting Genotypes", and "Determining Genotypes". [links]  Mousing over a link makes description of choice appear.

Determining Phenotypes:

User is told which allele is dominant and which is recessive: Picture of a green plant with an â€œRâ€ next to it; picture of the same plant but yellow with an â€œrâ€ next to it.

Computer randomly generates â€œRR,â€ â€œRr,â€ or â€œrr.â€
Two plants in middle of screen (green and yellow).  User must click the one with the correct color according to the given genotype.
Computer keeps track of # Correct and # Incorrect.

Predicting Genotypes:

Computer randomly generates 2 phenotypes (out of RR, Rr, and rr), which are placed on the outside of a Punnett square.  
Inside each cell are the choices RR, Rr, and rr.  User must click on the one that belongs in that cell.
Computer keeps track of # Correct and # Incorrect.

Determining Genotypes (Challenge):

User picks 2 parent plants of unknown genotypes out of a somewhat large selection, which will produce 20 offspring. [clicks on 2 random pictures of plants; each picture has an assigned genotype variable that is not revealed to the user]
Depending on the genotypes assigned by the computer to the 2 selected plants, the 20 offspring will be different colors.
User must determine the genotypes of the 2 original selected plants.

20 random plants, each with a random genotype and corresponding color, are scattered around the screen.
User clicks on 2 of these plants, selecting them to be the parents.
20 offspring are shown on the screen, the genotypes & colors of which are determined by the genotypes of the parents.
User selects the genotypes of the parents after seeing the colors of the offspring.
Computer keeps track of # Correct and # Incorrect.
