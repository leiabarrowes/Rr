#Functional Specification: Genetics Game#


##Introduction##

This web-based app game will help students learn the difference between dominant and recessive alleles and how different combinations are expressed in the phenotype.

This game is intended for practice only. Students will not be able to log in and track their individual progress.  Results will not be reported to the teacher.


##Home Page##

User chooses from "Determining Phenotypes", and "Predicting Genotypes", and "Determining Genotypes". (links)  
Mousing over a link makes description of choice appear.

###Link to "About" page###
Short paragraph describing general purpose of web site.
Picture bibliography


##What Color?##

User is told which allele is dominant and which is recessive: Picture of a green plant with an "R" next to it; picture of the same plant but yellow with an "r" next to it.

Computer randomly generates "RR", "Rr", or "rr".
Two plants in middle of screen (green and yellow).  User must click the one with the correct color according to the given genotype.
Computer keeps track of number Correct and number Incorrect.
"Back" link sends user back to home page.


##Punnett Squares##

Computer randomly generates 2 phenotypes (out of RR, Rr, and rr), which are placed on the outside of a Punnett square.  
Inside each cell are the choices RR, Rr, and rr.  User must click on the one that belongs in that cell.
Computer keeps track of number Correct and number Incorrect.
"Back" link sends user back to home page.


##Who are the Parents?##

User selects the genotypes of the parents after seeing the colors of the offspring.
Computer keeps track of number Correct and number Incorrect.
"Back" link sends user back to home page.
